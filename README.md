# Sound classification on ESC-50 dataset

Embarking on my inaugural venture into sound classification, I delved into the **ESC-50 dataset**, which comprises a collection of diverse environmental sounds, ranging from animal calls to mechanical noises. Employing `Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)` for feature extraction, I crafted a basic deep neural network architecture to decipher the nuances within the audio samples. Despite its simplicity, the model showcased a commendable performance, achieving an accuracy of approximately `50%`. This accomplishment, surpassing mere random guessing, signifies an encouraging foray into the domain of sound analysis and classification, setting the stage for further exploration and refinement in future endeavors.
